# e-commerce

Link to deployed Heroku version: https://sleepy-plains-82188.herokuapp.com/

## Description
This is a back end object relational mapping E-commerce application. I configured an express.js API with the help of sequelize to connect to the MySQL database. The API is full functional and tested within the Insomia software. Allowing the user to create, update, read, and delete desired items from the database. It essentially shares the same fundemental aspects of websites such as Shopify and WooCommerce(big E-commerce platforms).

## Installation

1) Copy all files to project folder
2) Open terminal for project
3) Install all dependecies using command "npm install"
4) Enter mysql credentials in a .env file
5) Open terminal and create sql database using mysql "source schema.sql" 
6) Open powershell terminal and run code "npm run seed" & "npm start"
7) The backend api should then populate and have full C.R.U.D. functionality

## User Story
